# Platform-Specific Testing Strategies for OTT Devices

This document outlines practical, real-world testing strategies for various OTT platforms, focusing on environment setup, app deployment, navigation, and testing techniques.

## 1. Roku Testing Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Enable Developer Mode on Roku device.
- Connect Roku device and test environment(for eg.Laptop running Roku Dev Tools) to the same wi-fi network.
- Use Roku Developer Dashboard and Device Access Protocol (DAP) for app sideloading and remote commands.
  - Roku Developer Dashboard is used to upload your app and control the device remotely.
  - Device Access Protocol (DAP) is a way to send commands to your Roku device over the network.

### Build & Deploy
- Package BrightScript apps as `.pkg` or `.zip`.
- Sideload apps using Roku’s web interface or automation scripts.
- Automate deployment with Roku’s External Control Protocol (ECP).
  - External Control Protocol (ECP) is a way to control your Roku device remotely using commands sent over the network.

### Testing Techniques
- UI navigation using a physical remote or remote control simulation.
- Test remote input delays, button mappings, and long presses.
- Monitor app launch time and responsiveness.
- Use Roku logs via telnet or dashboard for debugging.
- Automate with Roku ECP or third-party tools.

### Common Pitfalls
- Limited debugging visibility.
- Remote control input lag.
- Packaging errors that causes failed deployment.

## 2. Fire TV & Android TV Testing Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Use Android Studio with Android TV emulator or physical Fire TV devices.
- Enable ADB over network or USB.
- Connect devices to development environments.

### Build & Deploy
- Build APKs targeting Android TV.
- Install APKs using ADB commands or Play Store internal testing.

### Testing Techniques
- Test multiple input methods: remote, voice, input fields.
- Validate app events (app launch, background and foreground events, quit/close)
- Check UI scaling on different resolutions.
- Automate using UI Automator, Espresso, or Appium.

### Common Pitfalls
- Input method inconsistencies.
- UI scaling and resolution issues.
- Voice recognition variations.

## 3. Apple TV Testing Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Use Xcode with Apple TV Simulator or physical Apple TV device.
- Connect devices via network or USB-C.
- Use Xcode for deployment and debugging.

### Build & Deploy
- Build tvOS apps.
- Deploy using Xcode or TestFlight.

### Testing Techniques
- Validate Siri Remote gestures and clicks.
- Measure app performance and resource usage.
- Automate with XCTest or Appium tvOS support.

### Common Pitfalls
- Limited multi-touch support on remote.
- Simulator vs real device differences.
- Handling network interruptions.

## 4. LG & Samsung Smart TV Testing Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Use LG webOS and Samsung Tizen SDKs and emulators.
- Enable Developer Mode on TVs.
- Connect TVs to the development network.

### Build & Deploy
- Package web apps (`.ipk` for LG, `.wgt` for Samsung).
- Deploy via SDK or TV interfaces.
  - TV interfaces include browsers like Firefox for TV, Amazon Silk Browser, and Google Chrome for AndroidTV.

### Testing Techniques
- Test standard and voice remote navigation.
- Verify web app rendering on TV browsers.
- Monitor performance and memory usage.
- Automation is limited - consider Selenium/WebDriver or image recognition.

### Common Pitfalls
- Fragmented OS versions.
- Limited debugging tools.
- Slow app startups.

## 5. Web & Mobile OTT Testing Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Use real devices and emulators/simulators.
- Set up multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
- Test on various network conditions (Wi-Fi, 3G/4G/5G).

### Build & Deploy
- Deploy web apps to test servers.
- Install mobile apps via app stores or direct installations.

### Testing Techniques
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.
- Network throttling (intentional slowing down internet) to observe changes in video quality.
- Ad playback validation.
- Automate using Selenium, Playwright (web), and Appium (mobile).

### Common Pitfalls
- Browser-specific playback issues.
- Adaptive bitrate streaming problems on slow networks.
- Device performance affecting playback consistency.
