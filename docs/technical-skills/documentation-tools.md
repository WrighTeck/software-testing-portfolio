# 📝 Documentation Tools

This section shows how I leverage documentation tools to create high-quality, structured technical content that supports QA processes, onboarding, and knowledge sharing.

## 💼 Tools I Use

- **Confluence**  
  For creating and organizing:
  - QA process documentation  
  - Test strategies, test documenatation, and coverage matrices  
  - Technical how-to guides for team members.

- **Google Workspace & Microsoft Office Applications**
  Used to:
  - Draft testing references and onboarding checklists,  
  - Document **device setup instructions**, **automation configurations**, and **manual testing flows**  
  - Share collaboration-friendly test guides and feedback templates
  - Track data and feature integration on test and staging environments (using Excel).
  - Document app performance and data validation during ad hoc testing.

- **Markdown**  
  Used in:
  - GitHub README files for automation repos  
  - Lightweight, version-controlled test notes  
  - API Technical specifications.

## 📌 Real-World Applications

### 🔹 Test Documentation
- Documented structured test plans, test case descriptions, and test execution guides in **Confluence** and **Google Docs**.
- Created documentation templates used for regression cycles, device compatibility tracking, and exploratory testing sessions.
- Maintained a centralized knowledge base for both technical and non-technical team members.

### 🔹 Technical Guides & Setup Instructions
- Wrote easy-to-follow internal guides covering:
  - Test environment setup  
  - Mobile and OTT device configuration  
  - Emulator/simulator installation steps
  - Appium setup instructions.

### 🔹 Reporting & Communication
- Delivered weekly QA status updates via Word/PDF documents.
- Tracked bugs in spreadsheets during UAT to expedite triage and validation.
- Compiled QA onboarding documentation and contributed to team Confluence spaces for knowledge retention.

## 💡 Best Practices I Follow

- Keep documentation version-controlled and accessible to devs, testers, and product owners.
- Use consistent formatting, headers, and tables to improve readability.
- Link related documents (e.g., test plans → test runs → defect logs) for traceability.
- Regularly audit and update outdated documentation for ongoing QA relevance.
