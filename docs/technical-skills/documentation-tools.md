# 📝 Documentation Tools

This section shows how I leverage documentation tools to create high-quality, structured technical content that supports QA processes, team onboarding, and knowledge sharing.

## 💼 Tools I Use

- **Confluence**  
  For creating and organizing:
  - QA process documentation  
  - Test strategies and coverage matrices  
  - Test case repositories  
  - Technical how-to guides for stakeholders  

- **Google Workspace & Microsoft Office Applications**
  Used to:
  - Draft testing references and onboarding checklists  
  - Document **device setup instructions**, **automation configurations**, and **manual testing flows**  
  - Share collaboration-friendly test guides and feedback templates
  - Track data and feature integration on test and staging environments in Excel
  - Document app performance during ad hoc testing

- **Markdown**  
  Used in:
  - GitHub README files for automation repos  
  - Lightweight, version-controlled test notes  
  - Portable documentation for test workflows and bug reporting procedures

## 📌 Real-World Applications

### 🔹 Test Documentation
- Authored structured test plans, test case descriptions, and execution guides in **Confluence** and **Google Docs**.
- Created documentation templates used for regression cycles, device compatibility tracking, and exploratory testing sessions.
- Maintained a centralized knowledge base for both technical and non-technical team members.

### 🔹 Technical Guides & Setup Instructions
- Wrote easy-to-follow internal guides covering:
  - Test environment setup  
  - Mobile and OTT device configuration  
  - Emulator/simulator installation steps  
  - Automation tool integration (Appium, Playwright)

### 🔹 Reporting & Communication
- Delivered QA status updates via Word/PDF documents during sprint demos and release checkpoints.
- Tracked bugs in spreadsheets during UAT for rapid triage and fix validation.
- Compiled QA onboarding documentation and contributed to team Confluence spaces for knowledge retention.

## 📊 Deliverables Created

- Test Plans & Strategy Documents  
- Automation Setup Instructions  
- Device & Platform Test Guides  
- Bug Reporting Templates  
- Glossaries and Cheat Sheets  
- QA Best Practices & SOPs

## 💡 Best Practices I Follow

- Keep documentation version-controlled and accessible to devs, testers, and product owners.
- Use consistent formatting, headers, and tables to improve readability.
- Link related documents (e.g., test plans → test runs → defect logs) for traceability.
- Regularly audit and update outdated documentation for ongoing QA relevance.
