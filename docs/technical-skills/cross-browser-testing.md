# üåê Cross-Browser Testing

This section demonstrates how I perform cross-browser testing to ensure consistent functionality, visual integrity, and user experience across major web and mobile browsers.

---

## üß™ Browsers Tested

- **Google Chrome**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Safari**
- **Microsoft Edge**
- **Opera**

---

## ‚úÖ Real-World Testing Practices

### Functional Testing Across Browsers
- Verified core app workflows (login, forms, navigation, filters, media playback) across different browsers.
- Focused on interactive UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, modals) for consistency and responsiveness.

### Visual Validation
- Identified UI inconsistencies such as:
  - Misaligned elements
  - Font rendering issues
  - Overlapping components
  - Layout breaks in Safari and Opera

### Compatibility Scenarios
- Validated CSS behavior differences across browser engines.
- Checked HTML5 video/audio playback, especially for media apps and OTT platforms.
- Ensured functions worked without console errors across all browsers.

## Tools & Techniques Used

- **Manual Testing** on physical devices and Windows virtual machines (via Remote Deskop)
- **DevTools** (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari Web Inspector)
- **Responsive Design Mode** for simulating screen sizes and breakpoints
- Screenshot comparisons and screen recordings for defect logging

---

## Key Focus Areas

- UI alignment and layout consistency
- Form input validation and error handling
- Button, icon, and menu interactions
- Scroll behavior and fixed elements
- Font and color rendering differences
- Media controls and responsive breakpoints

---

## Sample Defects Found

- Rounded corners not rendering in Firefox due to missing CSS prefixes
- Safari ignoring default input styling on date pickers
- Opera showing misaligned modals on smaller screens

---

## Best Practices I Follow

- Always test with the latest stable version of each major browser.
- Prioritize issues based on user traffic analytics for supported browsers.
- Document and tag browser-specific bugs clearly for developers.
- Use baseline screenshots to detect unexpected UI shifts.
- Perform regression tests when releasing CSS or UI-related updates.
