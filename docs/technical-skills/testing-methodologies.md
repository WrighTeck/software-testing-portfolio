# ðŸ§ª Testing Methods â€“ Core QA Techniques

This section highlights my experience using a variety of testing methods to validate software functionality, usability, and performance across mobile, web, desktop, and OTT platforms. These methods were applied in both agile and waterfall environments to ensure quality releases.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Functional Testing
- Validated core features against business requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Verified data flows, calculations, permissions, and edge cases.
- Applied black-box testing techniques to ensure system functionality across all input scenarios.

## ðŸ”¹ Navigational Testing
- Ensured user flows work as intended from one screen/page to the next.
- Detected broken links, crashes, or invalid routes in mobile and web applications.
- Verified navigation logic under various user roles and device types.

## ðŸ”¹ Build Verification Testing (BVT) / Smoke Testing
- Performed **quick health checks** after every new build deployment.
- Identified showstopper bugs early to reduce wasted QA effort on unstable builds.

## ðŸ”¹ Boundary Value Testing (BVT)
- Applied **boundary value analysis** to test limits of input fields, form validation, and numeric ranges.
- Used BVT to expose off-by-one errors, missing validation logic, and data truncation bugs.
- Successfully applied this method across:
  - **Mobile apps:** Login fields, form inputs, and in-app purchases  
  - **Web apps:** Contact forms, CRM search filters, financial entry fields  
  - **OTT platforms:** Video seek bar limits, input fields on settings screens  
  - **Desktop applications:** Field validation for user profiles and data import/export features

## ðŸ”¹ Regression Testing
- Executed test cases to confirm that **updates/fixes didnâ€™t break existing functionality**.
- Developed regression suites for manual tests.
- Prioritized regression runs for high-impact workflows after code changes or bug fixes.

## ðŸ”¹ User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Supported business stakeholders during UAT cycles with training, issue triage, and fix verification.
- Helped translate requirements into testable scenarios for real-world business usage.
- Documented UAT feedback and tracked post-UAT changes through release.

## ðŸ”¹ Usability Testing
- Evaluated interface layout, accessibility, and user experience from an end-user perspective.
- Reported UX-related bugs and offered improvement suggestions based on user flow requirements.
- Applied usability testing to both OTT interfaces and mobile/web environments.

## ðŸ”¹ Performance Testing (Introductory Level)
- Conducted basic performance checks to measure load times and responsiveness.
- Evaluated upload latency, load performance across pages, and consistency of navigational workflows.

## âœ… Outcome
- Applied the right mix of testing strategies to support stable and high-quality releases.
- Reduced bug reoccurrence by identifying defects at multiple stages of the test lifecycle.
- Supported developers, product managers, and stakeholders with test coverage insights and issue tracking.
