# Test Management & Bug Tracking

This section highlights how I apply my skills in test management and defect tracking to maintain high standards of quality throughout the software development lifecycle.

---

## Tools I Use

- **Test Management Tools**:  
  - TestRail 
  - Xray (JIRA plugin)
  - Zephyr Squad 
  - Google Sheets / Excel for data collection and tracking.
  - Google Docs to document device setup, troubleshooting, and automation configurations.
  - Gherkin (for test case formatting and BDD workflows)

- **Bug Tracking Systems**:  
  - JIRA  
  - Bugzilla  
  - GitHub Issues  

- **UI Validation**:  
  - Figma (for reviewing OTT UI designs and validating screen transitions)

## âœ… Real-World Usage

### Writing and Managing Test Cases
- Created comprehensive test plans and test suites for **OTT platforms**, **mobile apps**, and **web applications**.
- Grouped test cases by feature, release cycle, and priority for easier regression and sanity runs.
- Used TestRail and Xray to track pass/fail metrics, coverage, and history of test executions.

### Defect Reporting & Triage
- Logged clear, concise, and reproducible defects using JIRA, adhering to severity and priority guidelines.
- Included:
  - Environment details (device, OS, version)
  - Reproduction steps (in structured or Gherkin format)
  - Logs (from Charles Proxy, browser console, Datadog, or ADB/Xcode)
  - Screenshots and screen recordings
- Collaborated with Product Owners, Developers, Technical Program Managers, and other QAs during bug triage meetings to verify, prioritize, and resolve issues efficiently.

### Integration with Agile Workflows
- Used JIRA boards (Scrum and Kanban) for tracking sprints, bug reports, test requirements, and regression tasks.
- Linked test cases and defects to epics, stories, and acceptance criteria for full traceability.
- Participated in Agile meetings: sprint planning, bug triage, retrospectives, and daily standups.

## KPI Tracking with Test Management Tools

I regularly use **TestRail**, **Zephyr Squad**, and **Xray** to gather and present test execution KPIs that help teams measure quality, readiness, and release confidence:

- **TestRail**:  
  - Monitors test execution progress in real-time by milestones and test runs.  
  - Tracks **pass/fail rate**, **blocked tests**, and **untested cases**.  
  - Generates pie charts and bar graphs for stakeholder reporting.  
  - Customizes filters to view KPIs by feature, test owner, or priority level.

- **Zephyr Squad**:  
  - Create Jira-integrated test execution dashboards.  
  - Calculates **test execution trends**, **success/failure rates**, and **test coverage**.  
  - Useful for agile sprints with built-in traceability to stories and epics.

- **Xray**:  
  - Offers advanced reports on **test coverage** by user stories, requirements, and epics.  
  - Visualizes metrics like **execution success ratio**, **cumulative execution over time**, and **overall readiness**.  
  - Supports traceability reports from test cases â†’ executions â†’ defects.

## ðŸ§  Technical Writing in Practice

- Documented and maintained test documenation using TestRail, Google Docs, and Confluence.
- Authored QA status reports, test execution summaries, and defect density metrics for stakeholder review.
- Created bug report templates and testing checklists to standardize QA processes across teams.

## ðŸ’¡ Bonus: Quick QA Practices I Follow

- Re-test and close bugs only after verifying against fixed builds.
- Tag test cases and defects with release versions, acceptance criteria, figma, and environments.
- Use filters and dashboards in JIRA to monitor regressions and reopened bugs.
- Maintain changelogs for test case updates across sprints and releases.
