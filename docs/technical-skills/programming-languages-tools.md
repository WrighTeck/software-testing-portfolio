# Programming Languages & Tools

This section highlights how I apply programming languages and developer tools in my QA testing, automation efforts, and software validation workflows.

---

## Programming Languages I Use

### 🔹 JavaScript
- Used for writing UI validation test scripts and test automation (e.g., with WebdriverIO and Playwright).
- Familiar browser debugging using Chrome DevTools and JavaScript console output.
- Applied to validate front-end logic, DOM interactions, and third-party integrations in OTT and web apps.

### 🔹 TypeScript
- Preferred for test automation projects where strong typing improves maintainability.
- Used in modern automation frameworks (e.g., Playwright + TypeScript) for testing responsive and interactive web apps.
- Helps prevent runtime errors in complex test scripts by leveraging type annotations and interfaces.

### 🔹 SQL
- Used for backend validation of test data and confirming business logic through direct database queries.
- Wrote SQL queries to:
  - Validate user data, content availability, and transactional integrity.
  - Cross-check UI responses against test and production databases.
  - Troubleshoot test failures by examining relational data conditions.

## 🛠️ Tools & IDEs I Work With

### 🔹 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- My primary code editor for JavaScript/TypeScript test automation.
- Leverage extensions for GitHub, Playwright, REST Client, and Markdown preview.
- Used integrated terminal for running test suites and command-line tools.

### 🔹 IntelliJ IDEA
- Used in Java-based environments for editing and navigating large-scale codebases.
- Helpful for reviewing backend services and collaborating on test integration with Java dev teams.

### 🔹 Eclipse (Academic)
- Utilized in enterprise environments where legacy Java code and JUnit/TestNG frameworks were in place.

### 🔹 Brackets
- Used primarily for front-end HTML/CSS/JS file inspection and quick edits during visual validation testing.
- Helpful in early-stage UI testing and prototyping.

## 💡 Best Practices I Follow

- Structure automation tests with reusable functions and clear assertions.
- Write SQL queries with data integrity.
- Maintain organized folders and README files within automation projects.
- Comment code clearly when scripting test flows or documenting logic.
