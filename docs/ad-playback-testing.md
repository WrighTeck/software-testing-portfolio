# Video Stream Ad Validation and Playback Test Flows

## Overview 
---
  This guide covers testing of video stream ads including pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll ads, cue points, playback behavior, skip functionality, click-through links,      loading times, ad timing, and rendering quality.Additional section provides testing Ad UI elements and quality.
---

## 1. Pre-Test Setup

- **Environment:**  
  Use a test or staging environment with test ad tags or sample creatives matching your ad server setup.

- **Devices/Platforms:**  
  Test across target devices and platforms to validate consistent ad behavior.

- **Tools:**  
  Network debugging tools (e.g., Charles Proxy) and device simulators for inspection.

---

## 2. Ad Playback Testing

### Pre-Roll Ads  
- Verify the pre-roll ad plays *before* main video content starts.  
- Check ad playback consistency, no freezes or skips unless user initiates.

### Mid-Roll Ads  
- Confirm mid-roll ads play at designated cue points (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% of content).  
- Validate timing accuracy of mid-roll ad triggers.

### Post-Roll Ads  
- Validate post-roll ads play immediately after main video ends.

---

## 3. User Controls & Interactions

- **Skip Functionality:**  
  Test skip button availability (where applicable) and correct skipping behavior if applicable.

- **Ad Click-Throughs:**  
  Verify clickable ads open intended landing pages or trigger relevant actions.

- **Playback Controls:**  
  Ensure mute/unmute and pause/resume during ads function correctly (if supported).

---

## 4. Ad Loading and Timing

- Check ad load times to avoid excessive buffering or delays.  
- Verify ad duration matches expected length and countdown timers are accurate.

---

## 5. Rendering and Visual Quality

- Confirm video and ad resolution quality are consistent.  
- Check for proper ad rendering without visual artifacts or glitches.

---

## 6. Error Handling

- Simulate ad load failures and ensure app gracefully recovers by skipping ad or proceeding with content.  
- Confirm no crash or hang occurs during ad errors.

---

## 7. Network Conditions

- Test ad playback under varying bandwidth scenarios to ensure adaptive bitrate streaming works correctly.

# UI Elements, Distortions, and Video Quality Test Flows

## Overview  
This section outlines how to validate UI elements, detect visual distortions, and ensure overall video playback quality for streaming platforms.

---

## 1. UI Elements Validation

- **Playback Controls:**  
  Verify presence, visibility, and functionality of play/pause, rewind, fast-forward, volume, fullscreen, and captions buttons.

- **Progress Bar & Timeframes:**  
  Confirm progress bar accurately reflects playback position; timeframes update correctly during playback and seeking.

- **Ad Indicators:**  
  Check for ad markers, countdown timers, and skip buttons appearing at correct times.

- **Error Messages:**  
  Validate clear, user-friendly error messages appear on network or playback issues.

---

## 2. Video Distortion Checks

- **Visual Artifacts:**  
  Look for pixelation, color banding, flickering, or freezing frames during playback.

- **Aspect Ratio & Scaling:**  
  Ensure video maintains correct aspect ratio without stretching or cropping on different screen sizes.

- **Buffering & Frame Drops:**  
  Detect excessive buffering events or frame drops impacting clean playback.

---

## 3. Video Quality Assessment

- **Resolution & Bitrate:**  
  Confirm video plays in expected resolutions (SD, HD, 4K) with appropriate bitrate for device/network conditions.

- **Adaptive Streaming Behavior:**  
  Verify smooth transistion between bitrates without noticeable quality drops or playback interruptions.

- **Audio-Video Sync:**  
  Ensure audio tracks are properly synchronized with video.

---

## 4. Testing Under Various Conditions

- **Device Types & Screen Sizes:**  
  Test on multiple devices and screen resolutions to validate consistent UI and video quality.

- **Network Conditions:**  
  Simulate bandwidth fluctuations to confirm adaptive streaming and UI response.
